# uMessenger
## Alpha 0.2 version

Small Messenger-like application designed to run from the command line, and works on the same LAN only (unless using NAT on the server side).
You can either download the full zip file, and compile it yourself, or download the two jar files and run it from the command line. I also uploaded two .cmd files that if placed in the same folder as the .jar files they will open in a new command windows.

Right now my plans on what to implement are the following:

- Usernames with password
- Ability to send files
- (More) Commands
