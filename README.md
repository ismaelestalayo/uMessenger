## Alpha 0.1 version

This is just a small project I'm currently working on after getting into Java programming in university.

Right now my plans on what to implement are the following:

- Usernames
- Ability to send files
- Commands

The "Barebone_" files are the code from the first commit, just in case you want to see the basic code and not the extra stuff.

Feel free to suggest anything.
