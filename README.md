# uMessenger
## Alpha 0.1 version

This is just a small project I'm currently working on after getting into Java programming in university. It's a small Messenger-like application designed to run from the command line, and works on the same LAN only (unless using NAT on the server side).

Right now my plans on what to implement are the following:

- Usernames with password
- Ability to send files
- (More) Commands


Feel free to suggest anything.
