# uMessenger - Beta 1.3

Small Messenger-like application designed to run from the command line, and works on the same LAN only (unless using NAT on the server side with a Raspberry for example). **It's important to have userList.txt on the directory where the server is.**

If you wanna try it yourself you can either:

- Download the zip of the full repository and compile it yourself on your favourite IDE.

- Or download the zip file for being either a server or a client and run the corresponding .jar from the command line. Click on one of the rar files, and in the upper right corner, click on raw to download it.

 _Inside the rar there are .cmd files that executes `java -jar uMessenger_Client.jar` in a new command window (perfect for lazy people like myself)_.

#Changelog:
####1.3:
- Probably last beta version, as I have already fixed most of the issues and it's stable.
- Added a color for each username up to 6 users (then colors will be repeated, because of limits of the cmd).

####1.2:
- Notification to all users when a new user joins.
- Sending files between different networks should be working now.

####1.1:
- Changed most of the code from using `dos.sendUTF()` to `oos.sendObject()` to make easier understanding the code and adding more functionality in the future.
- Notification when a client dissconects closing the windows instead of `/fin`.
- Character ยบ won't crash the app anymore.
- Sending a blank message won't crash anymore either.

####1.0:
- First beta version (previously Alpha).
- Sending files finally work! (On the same LAN atm).
- A lot of bugfixes.
- Added `/IPs` and `/users` commands.

#Future plans:

- ~~Usernames~~ with password

_NOTE:_
_I made the sending of files so that I could change the size of the segments I was sending, but the only size where the videos weren't corrupted was at the size of 1 byte. Even so, I've left the code there, so if you wanna try it yourself, on the FileSending class just change `con.sendArray(fileDumpedInArray, 1)`  to the size of segment you want, bear in mind that most files will be corrupted although I noticed photos not being corrupted but severely altered with a segment size greater than 500._
