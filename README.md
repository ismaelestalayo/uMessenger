# uMessenger - Alpha 0.5 version

Small Messenger-like application designed to run from the command line, and works on the same LAN only (unless using NAT on the server side with a Raspberry for example). **It's important to have userList.txt on the directory where the server is.**

If you wanna try it yourself you can either:

- Download the full zip file, and compile it yourself on your favourite IDE.

- Or download the two jar files and run it from the command line.
_I also uploaded two .cmd files that if placed in the same directory as the .jar files they will open in a new command window (perfect for lazy people like myself)_.

Right now my plans on what to implement are the following:

- ~~Usernames~~ with password
- ~~Ability to send files~~
- (More) Commands
